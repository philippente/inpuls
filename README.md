GPS
======

This code is a reimplementation of the guided policy search algorithm and LQG-based trajectory optimization.

The original code base of this project is from [rll.berkeley.edu/gps](http://rll.berkeley.edu/gps) and was reimplemented here for industrial usage. This includes algorithm improvements, support for OPC-UA communication and multiple vizualisation tools.

This project is funded by VDMA germany. For further information please visit [i40-inpuls.de](http://i40-inpuls.de)
